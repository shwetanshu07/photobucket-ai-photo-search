# unlike the backend buildspec this one is only responsible for packaging the fe into artifact
# in this i have used CodePipeline's native S3 deploy provider in the deploy stage
# i have done this to cover both the ways in which we can handle deployment and its actually simpler
# the s3 provider handles file extraction automatically
